# ROOT in CPP

 - [basics.C](basics.C) - Contains the basic function and histogram plotting macros
 - [scatterPlots_cuts.C](scatterPlots_cuts.C) - macros for reading TTree from files and creating scatter plots and applying cuts on the TTree data. This has two macros - one which plots different histograms on the same canvas in different pads, another which uses `std::vector` to dynamically create canvases for each plot.
 - [Analyze.C](Analyze.C), [Analyze.h](Analyze.h) - templates for analyzing TTree generated by ROOT by running command `tree1->MakeSelector("Analyze")`.
 - [AnalyzeReader.C](AnalyzeReader.C) - analyzing ROOT file using custom macro with TTreeReader. This also includes cuts.
