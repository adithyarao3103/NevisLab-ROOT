# ROOT practice files for the Nevis Lab

This repository contains practice files for the Nevis Lab, taught by [William Seligman](https://www.nevis.columbia.edu/~seligman/). 

The implementations in C++ are in the CPP folder, while the implementations in Python are in the IPYNB folder.

To run these locally, you will need to have a local installation of ROOT.
