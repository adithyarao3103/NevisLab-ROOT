# ROOT practice files for the Nevis Lab

This repository contains practice files for the Nevis Lab, taught by [William Seligman](https://www.nevis.columbia.edu/~seligman/) in both C and Python. 

The implementations in C are in the CPP folder, while the implementations in Python are in the IPYNB folder. To run these locally, you will need to have a local installation of ROOT. Further details are presented in the README files in the folders.
